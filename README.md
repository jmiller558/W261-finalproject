# w261 Final Project

### Project Name: 
* #### Predicting Flight Delays

### Team Members:
* #### Brittany Dougall, Jesse Miller, Chris Skokowski, Fengjiao Sun

## Project Objectives

* #### The objective of this project was to predict flight delays leveraging three datasets: a flights table, a weather table, and a station table that connects the flights and weather data by weather stations. The question formulated was a binary classification question - will the flight be delayed/cancelled/diverted, or not. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost were employed in our analysis.
